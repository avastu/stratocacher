# Stratocacher monorepo [![Build Status][build-badge-img]][build-url]

### A cache with pluggable layers.

# Monorepo?

It's a thing, now.  All the cool kids are doing it, like [React](https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/master/packages), [Meteor](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/tree/devel/packages), [Ember](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/tree/master/packages), and [Babel](https://github.com/babel/babel/tree/master/packages).  All of the packages are versioned in lockstep, which makes it easier for us to make strong guarantees about the interoperability of the packages that work together in the react-server ecosystem.

# Stratocacher?

The best place to start is [stratocacher's README](packages/stratocacher/README.md).
